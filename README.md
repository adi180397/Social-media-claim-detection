# Social-media-claim-detection
# Overview
The Social Media Claim Detection project aims to detect and classify claims made on social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook. With the proliferation of misinformation and fake news on social media, it has become increasingly important to develop automated systems that can identify false or misleading claims and provide users with accurate information.
# Features
Claim Classification: The project employs machine learning and natural language processing techniques to classify social media claims into different categories, such as true, false, misleading, or unverified. <br>
Text Preprocessing: Various text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming, are applied to clean and normalize the text data before classification.
Embedding Generation: Embeddings are generated using state-of-the-art models like GPT-2 or BERT to represent the textual content of social media claims in a high-dimensional vector space.
Model Training and Evaluation: Classification models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or deep learning architectures, are trained on labeled datasets and evaluated for accuracy and performance.
Deployment: Once trained, the classification model can be deployed as a service to automatically analyze and classify social media claims in real-time.
